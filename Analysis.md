## Mapping Trends
While making the map to indicate the most popular start and end stations, I noticed that there was a lot of overlap in midtown but an increase in popularity of end stations outside of the main city. Other than that, the trend seems to be most riders use it to get around within the general Manhattan area.
Each bubble on the map can be highlighted to showcase the exact station name and it's address.

## Ride Time Trends
There were a few interesting trends among ride times:
- A majority of rides occured on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays between 5-6pm. 
- Rides between 12am and 1AM nearly double on the weekends.
- Rides from 8pm-11pm are generally consistent throughout the week, including weekends.

## Members vs. Casual Trends
One of the most interesting trends to note about members vs casual riders is the number of rides that members take vs the actual average ride length. While members make up more than 75% of the total rides, on average the ride length for a casual user is more than twice as long as the average ride length for a member. This might indicate that casual members use the service to forego taking other means of public transportation potentially due to lack of knowledge. Meanwhile, members are specifically using the service in a more effecient manner, looking to cover shorter distances in shorter amounts of time compared to traditional methods.
